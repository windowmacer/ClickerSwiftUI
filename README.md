# Clicker SwiftUI

## Project Description: Clicker Game

This project is an example implementation of a Clicker game using SwiftUI. 
The Clicker game is a popular game genre where the player has to click on an object on the screen to earn points, which can then be used to purchase upgrades or progress to higher levels.

The main features of the game include:

- A main screen with a clickable object that generates points for the player when clicked.
- A store screen where the player can purchase upgrades using their accumulated points.
- A progress system that unlocks new levels as the player accumulates more points.
- A leaderboard system that displays the top players and their scores.

The project is written in Swift and uses SwiftUI for the user interface. It also makes use of various Swift features, such as closures and protocols, to implement the game logic.
